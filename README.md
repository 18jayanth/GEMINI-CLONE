## ✅ Bonus: Automate commit style using commitlint

If you're interested in advanced usage:
- Use [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to enforce clean commit messages.
- Use `prettier` and `eslint` to write clean code.

If you tell me what your project is about, I can help write your `README.md` and some commit messages!
